# ElevateLabs_Task2
**Taks 2**: Exploratory Dat Analysis (EDA)<br>
This repository involves examining datasets to summarize their characteristics and uncover patterns, trends, relationships, and anomalies.It is primarily focused on understanding the data's structure and identifying any possible issues before applying more complex machine learning techniques.<br>

#**Dataset**
<br>
loan_data_1.csv
<br>

#**Tools**
<br>
- Python<br>
- Numpy<br>
- Pandas<br>
- Numpy<br>
- Scikit-learn<br>
- Jupyter Notebook<br>

#**Tasks Performed in the dataset**
<br>-**Generating summary statistics**<br>
This task involves computing key statistical measures (mean,median,mode,std deviation) that summarize the central tendency, spread, and shape of the data's distribution for each feature (variable).
<br>-**Visualizing numerical features**<br>
This involves creating visualizations that show the distribution and relationships of numerical features in the dataset. Histograms and box plots are used to visualize all the numeric feature.
<br>-**Correlation Matrix for reature relationship**<br>
A correlation matrix is a table showing correlation coefficients between variables. Each value in the table represents the relationship between two variables.
<br>-**Possible inferences from data visual**<br>
This involves infering patterns,relationships, and anamolies in data by visually presenting information.
